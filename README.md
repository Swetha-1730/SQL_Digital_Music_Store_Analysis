# Music Store Data Analysis 

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing data from a music store database, which includes tables such as customer, invoice, track, artist, genre, and album. The objective is to derive meaningful insights by executing a series of SQL queries that address various aspects of the business, including revenue generation, customer behaviour, artist performance, and genre popularity. The queries range from basic data retrieval to more complex recursive operations, providing a thorough examination of the dataset. Additionally, Excel was utilized for graph visualization of the results, enhancing the clarity and presentation of trends and insights.
